    "## 📘 Project Overview\n",
    "This project analyzes public reactions to Donald Trump’s 2025 statement about Nigeria using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  \n",
    "We’ll collect and analyze tweets and news articles to understand:\n",
    "- The **overall sentiment** (positive, negative, neutral)  \n",
    "- The **dominant topics and themes** being discussed  \n",
    "- The **key entities** (people, countries, organizations) mentioned  \n",
    "- How sentiment and discussion evolved **over time**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this project demonstrates how Data Science and NLP can quantify social media reaction and provide meaningful insights into global political discourse.\n"
